[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler)


## note about the 3.0 line

It's a complete rewrite of rufus-scheduler.

There is no EventMachine-based scheduler anymore.


## Notables changes:

* As said, no more EventMachine-based scheduler
* ```scheduler.every('100') {``` will schedule every 100 seconds (previously, it would have been 0.1s). This aligns rufus-scheduler on Ruby's ```sleep(100)```
* The scheduler isn't catching the whole of Exception anymore, only StandardException

## job options

### :blocking => true

By default, jobs are triggered in their own, new thread. When :blocking => true, the job is triggered in the scheduler thread (a new thread is not created). Yes, while the job triggers, the scheduler is not scheduling.

### :overlap => false

Since, by default, jobs are triggered in their own new thread, job instances might overlap. For example, a job that takes 10 minutes and is scheduled every 7 minutes will have overlaps.

To prevent overlap, one can set :overlap => false. Such a job will not trigger if one of its instance is already running.

### :mutex => mutex_instance / mutex_name / array of mutexes

Array of mutexes: original idea and implementation by [Rainux Luo](https://github.com/rainux)


## parsing cronlines
