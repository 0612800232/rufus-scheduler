(3.0)

[o] merge schedule_queue and unschedule_queue (and merge [un]schedule steps)
[x] OR stop using queue, since we've got the thread-safe JobArray
[x] if possible, drop the mutex in JobArray
    NO, that mutex is necessary for Scheduler#jobs (on JRuby an co)...
[o] named mutexes

[ ] :lockfile => x, timestamp, process_id, thread_id...
    warning: have to clean up that file on exit... or does the scheduler
    timestamps it?

[ ] idea: :mutex => x and :skip_on_mutex => true ?
    would prevent blocking/waiting for the mutex to get available
    :mutex => [ "mutex_name", true ]
    :mutex => [ [ "mutex_name", true ], [ "other_mutex_name", false ] ]

[o] timeout (as in rufus-scheduler 2.x)
[o] Rufus::Scheduler#running_jobs (as in rufus-scheduler 2.x)
[ ] Rufus::Scheduler#terminate_all_jobs
[ ] RepeatJob #pause / #resume
[ ] Rufus::Scheduler.start_new (backward comp) (with deprec note?)

[ ] job tags and find_by_tag(t) (as in rs 2.x)

[ ] document frequency

[ ] :last[_in|_at] and first[_in|_at] for RepeatJob (last and first)
[ ] :times for RepeatJob (how many recurrences)


################################################################################

(was 2.0)

[o] spec for jobs in the past (in and at)
[o] :discard_past

[o] every
[o] cron

[o] CHECK every and unschedule !!!

[o] :tags
[o] timeout feature (at/in/every/cron) in Job class

[o] :first_in, :first_at

[x] :dont_reschedule (or block returns false ?)

[o] [get_]jobs methods
[o] find methods

[x] CTRL-C during tests : allow, trap_int...

[o] 1.9
[o] j1.2.0

[o] revise trigger block arity
    use a compatibility switch ? yes

[o] synchronize @cron_jobs ?

[o] why not : make it work even if EM is not present
    EmScheduler < Scheduler
    FiberScheduler < Scheduler

[x] :blocking => 'blockname' idea, mutex = @mutexes['blockname'] ...
[o] eventually, make sleep frequency customizable

[o] PlainScheduler : name thread

[o] document :blocking

[o] README.rdoc
[o] fix jruby120 --em

[o] handle_exception (job, e)

[o] Schedulable

[o] Rufus::Scheduler.start_new() : autodetect EM ?
[o] check :blocking and every (reschedule blocking...)
[o] document :thread_name scheduler option

[o] unify cron_jobs#trigger_matching_jobs(now) and jobs#job_to_trigger
[o] pluggable job queues

[ ] Joel's complaint about timeout jobs gone ballistic
[x] move trigger_job out of the scheduler
